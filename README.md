## :clipboard: Description
In this project we will create a proof of concept by using Amazon Web Services to build
out a web/mobile application for students to load, track and trigger reminders. This
application should allow for institutions to maintain their own page in order to load student
schedules, campus maps, assignment deadlines test and examination schedules to
name a few.
